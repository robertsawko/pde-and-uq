# Burgers 1D example

I am working on reproducing the results from
[this](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/470/2171/20140080) paper
with [Proteus code](http://proteus.usace.army.mil/). One objective is to learn
Proteus which is DG-FEM code, another is to understand the paper better.

## TODO list

  * Solution procedure
    * simple settings
    * DG settings
  * Initial conditions
    * Sine wave initial condition
    * Rieman Initial conditions
    * Simple Gauss-sine initial condition
    * Karhnen-Loeve expansion for initial condition
      * Karhnen-Loeve tests from Gahnem book
      * Projection of KL onto Fourier base
  * Forcing term - sum of sines
  * Multiple simulations
